## Objective
The goal of this crash course was to gain hands-on experience with **Linux/Unix system administration**. Students learned to navigate the command line, manage users and permissions, and perform essential system operations.

---

## Key Skills Learned
- Navigating the Linux filesystem using commands like `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`.  
- Managing files and directories (`touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`).  
- Understanding file permissions and using `chmod`, `chown`, and `umask`.  
- User and group management (`useradd`, `groupadd`, `passwd`).  
- Process monitoring and management with `ps`, `top`, and `kill`.  
- Basic shell scripting for automation.  
- Using package managers (`apt-get`, `yum`) for software installation.

## Reflection
This course gave me a strong foundation in working with **Unix-based systems**, which underpins much of modern cybersecurity. It also built confidence in using Linux distributions such as **Kali Linux** and **Ubuntu**, which I later applied in cybersecurity labs involving intrusion detection, log analysis, and forensic investigations.
