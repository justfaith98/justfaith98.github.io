**Cybersecurity Specialist | Social Engineering Enthusiast** | Aspiring SOC Analyst

Welcome to my portfolio. I’m passionate about understanding the *human* side of cybersecurity—  
studying how attackers exploit psychology, and building awareness through phishing simulations,  
training, and hands-on social engineering labs.
