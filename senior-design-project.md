# üöÄ Senior Design Project: Leveraging Virtual Machines for Workplace Phishing Attack Mitigation

## üìù Project Summary
[cite_start]This project focused on using virtual machines to simulate and educate employees on how to identify, differentiate, and mitigate phishing attacks in a workplace environment[cite: 126, 134]. [cite_start]Despite advancements in cybersecurity, phishing remains a primary source of data breaches and monetary loss for companies[cite: 73]. [cite_start]The project's goal was to create an effective, hands-on training program that uses VM software to simulate real-world phishing scenarios[cite: 75].

### Key Takeaways
- [cite_start]**The Importance of Planning:** Proper planning and preparation are crucial, as technical hurdles, like setting up VMs and creating realistic scenarios, can cause significant delays[cite: 137, 138].
- [cite_start]**Monitoring and Evaluation:** Continuous evaluation of training is necessary to combat evolving threats and user behaviors[cite: 140].
- [cite_start]**Problem-Solving:** A key challenge was a third-party application issue with Google's security, which was resolved by using a different SMTP server after thorough research[cite: 112, 113, 114].
- [cite_start]**Lessons Learned:** The project provided valuable experience in cybersecurity operations, including setting up systems, installing tools, and practicing phishing with tools[cite: 165].

## üíª Presentation Overview
The project leveraged several materials to create a hands-on training module:
- [cite_start]**Virtualization Software:** VMWare, VirtualBox, or Parallels[cite: 77, 78].
- [cite_start]**Virtual Machines:** Kali Linux and an email server[cite: 79].
- [cite_start]**Phishing Simulation Software:** SEToolkit in Kali Linux was used for the simulation[cite: 80, 81].
- [cite_start]**Training Materials:** Educational modules, user guides, and policies were developed for employees[cite: 82, 83].

The project followed a structured schedule, from initial project kickoff and research to scenario development, VM setup, and final testing. [cite_start]The simulation involved sending a malicious email from a spoofed address with a suspicious attachment to a target[cite: 101, 102].

## üì∏ Screenshots
The final presentation included several screenshots to illustrate the project's process and results, including:
- [cite_start]A screenshot of the phishing email with a suspicious attachment and an incorrect email address [cite: 122].
- [cite_start]A screenshot of the final training module that was designed [cite: 123].
- A screenshot of the Kali Linux terminal used for the phishing simulation .
