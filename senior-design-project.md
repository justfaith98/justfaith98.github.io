# üöÄ Senior Design Project: Leveraging Virtual Machines for Workplace Phishing Attack Mitigation

## üìù Project Summary
This project focused on using virtual machines to simulate and educate employees on how to identify, differentiate, and mitigate phishing attacks in a workplace environmen. Despite advancements in cybersecurity, phishing remains a primary source of data breaches and monetary loss for companies. The project's goal was to create an effective, hands-on training program that uses VM software to simulate real-world phishing scenarios.

### Key Takeaways
- **The Importance of Planning:** Proper planning and preparation are crucial, as technical hurdles, like setting up VMs and creating realistic scenarios, can cause significant delays.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Continuous evaluation of training is necessary to combat evolving threats and user behaviors.
- **Problem-Solving:** A key challenge was a third-party application issue with Google's security, which was resolved by using a different SMTP server after thorough research.
- **Lessons Learned:** The project provided valuable experience in cybersecurity operations, including setting up systems, installing tools, and practicing phishing with tools.

## üíª Presentation Overview
The project leveraged several materials to create a hands-on training module:
- **Virtualization Software:** VMWare, VirtualBox, or Parallels.
- **Virtual Machines:** Kali Linux and an email server.
- **Phishing Simulation Software:** SEToolkit in Kali Linux was used for the simulation.
- **Training Materials:** Educational modules, user guides, and policies were developed for employees.

The project followed a structured schedule, from initial project kickoff and research to scenario development, VM setup, and final testing. The simulation involved sending a malicious email from a spoofed address with a suspicious attachment to a target.
